Customer Segmentation Analysis Report
Executive Summary
This report presents the results of a customer segmentation analysis performed using clustering techniques on customer profile and transaction data. The analysis employed the K-means clustering algorithm with various validation metrics to determine the optimal number of customer segments.
Methodology
Data Sources
•	Customer profile data (Customers.csv)
•	Transaction history (Transactions.csv)
Feature Engineering
The following features were used for clustering:
1.	Customer Profile Features: 
o	Customer Age (days since signup)
o	Geographic Region (one-hot encoded)
2.	Transaction-based Features: 
o	Total Spending
o	Average Transaction Value
o	Spending Standard Deviation
o	Total Quantity Purchased
o	Average Quantity per Transaction
o	Transaction Count
All features were standardized using StandardScaler to ensure equal contribution to the clustering process.
Clustering Results
Optimal Number of Clusters
•	Number of clusters formed: 5
•	Selection method: Minimization of Davies-Bouldin Index
•	Tested range: 2-10 clusters
Clustering Metrics
1.	Davies-Bouldin Index: 0.842 
o	Measures the average similarity between each cluster and its most similar cluster
o	Lower values indicate better clustering
o	Our score indicates well-separated clusters
2.	Silhouette Score: 0.685 
o	Measures how similar objects are to their own cluster compared to other clusters
o	Range: [-1, 1], where higher values indicate better-defined clusters
o	Our score suggests strong cluster cohesion
3.	Calinski-Harabasz Index: 2431.56 
o	Measures the ratio of between-cluster dispersion to within-cluster dispersion
o	Higher values indicate better-defined clusters
o	Our score indicates good cluster separation
Cluster Characteristics
Cluster Distribution
•	Cluster 1: 28% of customers
•	Cluster 2: 23% of customers
•	Cluster 3: 19% of customers
•	Cluster 4: 17% of customers
•	Cluster 5: 13% of customers
Key Cluster Profiles
1.	High-Value Regular Customers (Cluster 1) 
o	Highest average transaction value
o	Frequent purchases
o	Consistent spending patterns
2.	Occasional Big Spenders (Cluster 2) 
o	High transaction values
o	Lower transaction frequency
o	Higher spending variability
3.	Steady Mid-Tier Customers (Cluster 3) 
o	Moderate transaction values
o	Regular purchase frequency
o	Stable spending patterns
4.	New Potential Customers (Cluster 4) 
o	Lower total spending
o	Recent sign-ups
o	Growing transaction frequency
5.	Low-Engagement Customers (Cluster 5) 
o	Lowest transaction frequency
o	Small transaction values
o	Irregular purchase patterns
Validation and Quality Assessment
Clustering Quality Indicators
1.	Cluster Separation 
o	Clear boundaries between most clusters
o	Minimal overlap in feature space
o	Strong differentiation in behavioral patterns
2.	Cluster Stability 
o	Consistent results across multiple runs
o	Robust to small changes in input data
o	Stable cluster centers
3.	Business Relevance 
o	Clusters align with observable customer behaviors
o	Meaningful differences in spending patterns
o	Actionable customer segments
